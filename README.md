# KDB+ q
Notes and coding practice of KDB+ and q programming language.

KDB+ is an **in-memory column-oriented** database, developed by Kx Systems Inc, that utilises the vector language known as q.
Q is a interpreted vector based dynamically typed language built for speed and expressiveness. What's beautiful about kdb+ is that since tables are columns of vectors, all the power of the q language can be used as easily on table data as it was on lists. KDB+ is designed to capture, analyze, compare, and store data âˆ’ all at high speeds and on high volumes of data.

It is widely used by almsot all financial insititutions (Market Makers, Investement banks, Commercial banks and Exchanges).
